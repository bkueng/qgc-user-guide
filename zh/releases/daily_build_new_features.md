# Daily Build Major Changes

This topic contains a high level and *non-exhaustive* list of new features added to *QGroundControl* since the last [stable release](../releases/release_notes.md). These features are available in [daily builds](../releases/daily_builds.md).

* [Pattern Presets](../PlanView/PatternPresets.md) - Allows you to save settings for a Pattern item (Survey, Corridor Scan, ...) into a named preset. You can then use this preset over and over again as you create new Pattern.
